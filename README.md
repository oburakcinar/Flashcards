# Flashcards app
Simple desktop application created with Java

# About the Project
I developed this application upon completing University of Helsinki Java Programming I and II online course. I aimed for applying 
the theorical knowledge I gained from the course to a hands-on project where I could reinforce the course material and showcase my skills.

This application is a basic flashcards app which is used for testing and improving memory through practiced information retrieval. 

The application allows user to create multiple flashcards lists and shows its content when clicked on each list.

Inside each list, user can execute CRUD(create,read,update,delete) operations.

Clicking on practice button, user can test himself/herself by guessing the definition of randomly selected word from the list.
